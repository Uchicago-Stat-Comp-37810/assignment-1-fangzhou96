## Question 6
**while statements: section 4.1.3, exercises 4**
```{r}
i <- 0.006
diff <- 1

while (diff > 0.000001)
{
  diff <- abs(i-((1-((1+i)^(-20)))/19))
  i <- (1-((1+i)^(-20)))/19
}
print(i)

```
I have tried other starting guesses(which shows as below), and can find that the value we get are almost the same, which is around 0.0049~0.00495.


```{r}
i <- 0.002
diff <- 1

while (diff > 0.000001)
{
  diff <- abs(i-((1-((1+i)^(-20)))/19))
  i <- (1-((1+i)^(-20)))/19
}
print(i)
```
